# ✅ Week05 Bootcamp2019 Project: To-do List

### Goal: Build a Simple To-do List

### How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This to-do list required a basic framework for the HTML, and I had free reigns on the CSS (which was rewarding for me to setup after ensuring my code worked). This specific to-do list required an add button, a clear button, and a (more specific) clear-completed button. Additionally, the to-do should offer the functionality of striking through items once completed, as well as an updated count on how many items are left to accomplish at the bottom of the page.

### Lessons Learned:
This was my very first in-lab project using JavaScript- and it was daunting, mainly because I was overwhelmed with the conceptualization of the clear-completed button. This was alleviated by learning to add a for loop for my clear completed function- and voila. 

### Bottom line: 
```
I completed the challenge: 5
I feel good about my code: 5
I received life-saving help from Ellie to optimize the 'clear completed' button. ❤️
